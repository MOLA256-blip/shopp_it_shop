# Flutterwave "API Key Required" Error - Fix

## üö® Error You're Seeing

```
checkout.js:6 Uncaught (in promise) Error: API key required
ravesandboxapi.flutterwave.com/flwv3-pug/getpaidx/api/charge?use_polling=1:1 
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
```

## üîç What This Means

The Flutterwave checkout page is loading, but it's missing the **public API key**. This happens when:
1. The backend doesn't have the Flutterwave public key set
2. The backend isn't sending it to Flutterwave correctly
3. The key is invalid or expired
